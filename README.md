## Project Description: 
This project tracks data around the spread of Covid-19 infections using data from John Hopkins Covid-19 daily reports (csv file). Users are presented with a GUI that lets them select date ranges and locations to display how the virus has progressed over that time frame.

## Build Instructions:
To build this program simply download the JAR file and run it. The application reads Covid-19 information from a CSV file, which must be named "data" and be placed in the same directory as the JAR file by the user. An example data file has been included in this project's zip file, as well as on the project's GitHub page. If you would like to download more up to date data you do that [here](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases).

## Future Work:
The main thing we would like to look into implementing in future builds of this program is the ability for the CSV file to self-update daily. We would also like to give the user more options of places to track, such as states, regions, and territories instead of just countries. The last feature we discussed for a future update is being able to display multiple lines on the graph at the same time, so a user could instantly compare the spread in different locations.
